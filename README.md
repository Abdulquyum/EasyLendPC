# EasyLendPC 

EasyLendPC is an innovative web-based platform designed to connect individuals and professionals who need short-term access to a laptop with those willing to lend theirs. The platform bridges the gap between urgent laptop needs and individuals or businesses that can offer their laptops for rent. By prov iding a trusted environment, EasyLendPC helps users meet pressing deadlines, handle unforeseen contingencies, and fulfill professional or personal commitments requiring a functional laptop, all within a negotiable rental framework.

The platform‚Äôs primary objective is to resolve challenges such as missed deadlines due to the unavailability of a computer, urgent short-term laptop needs during travel, and the inability of personal laptops to meet specific demands. EasyLendPC simultaneously offers business-minded individuals and companies an additional revenue stream by allowing them to rent out their laptops, monetizing otherwise idle hardware.

## Setup and Installation
### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Virtualenv
- SQLite (for development)

### Installation

Follow these steps to run the application on your local machine.
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abdulquyum/EasyLendPC.git
    cd EasyLendPC
    ```

2. Run the setup script:
    ```bash
    ./setup/setup_easylendpc.sh
    ```
   This script:
	- installs the python venv package on your system if it doesn't exist,
	- creates a virtual environment named *easylendpc_env*,
	- activates the virtual environment and installs the app dependencies (defined in setup/requirements.txt) in it, and
	- closes the virtual environment.

3. Start the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source easylendpc_env/bin/activate
    ```

4. Start the *API* on one terminal:
    ```bash
    python3 -m api.telegram_bot.bot
    ```
    The API is configured to run on port 5000 of your machine, so ensure nothing else is running on that port.

5. Start the *app* on another terminal:
    ```bash
    python3 manage.py runserver    ```
    The app is configured to run on port 8000 of your machine, so ensure nothing else is running on that port. You can modify this setting in the *app/app.py* file.

6. Run the application:
Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to start using the app.
